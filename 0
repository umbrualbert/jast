                      First line of this file say whether the data is to be read in sequence
                      (SEQUENTIAL), random (RANDOM), or user (USER) order.
                      Each line corresponds to one call and has one or more ';' delimited data
                      fields. Those fields can be referred as [field0], [field1], ... in the xml
                      scenario file.  Several CSV files can be used simultaneously (syntax: -inf
                      f1.csv -inf f2.csv ...)
   -infindex        : file field
                      Create an index of file using field.  For example -inf users.csv -infindex

   -ip_field        : Set which field from the injection file contains the IP address from which
                      the client will send its messages.
                      If this option is omitted and the '-t ui' option is present, then field 0 is
                      assumed.
                      Use this option together with '-t ui'

*** RTP behaviour options:

   -mi              : Set the local media IP address (default: local primary host IP address)
   -rtp_echo        : Enable RTP echo. RTP/UDP packets received on port defined by -mp are echoed
                      to their sender.
                      RTP/UDP packets coming on this port + 2 are also echoed to their sender
                      (used for sound and video echo).

                      pressing '+' key to increase call rate by 1 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '-' key to decrease call rate by 1 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '*' key to increase call rate by 10 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '/' key to decrease call rate by 10 * rate_scale.
                      
   -rp              : Specify the rate period for the call rate.  Default is 1 second and default
                      unit is milliseconds.  This allows you to have n calls every m milliseconds
                      (by using -r n -rp m).
                      Example: -r 7 -rp 2000 ==> 7 calls every 2 seconds.
                               -r 10 -rp 5s => 10 calls every 5 seconds.
   -rate_scale      : Control the units for the '+', '-', '*', and '/' keys.

                      you to increase the load for each independent logging period.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -fd 10s
                        ==> increase calls by 10 every 10 seconds.
   -rate_max        : If -rate_increase is set, then quit after the rate reaches this value.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -rate_max 100
                        ==> increase calls by 10 until 100 cps is hit.
   -no_rate_quit    : If -rate_increase is set, do not quit after the rate reaches -rate_max.
   -l               : Set the maximum number of simultaneous calls. Once this limit is reached,
                      traffic is decreased until the number of open calls goes down. Default:
                        (3 * call_duration (s) * rate).
   -m               : Stop the test and exit when 'calls' calls are processed
   -users           : Instead of starting calls at a fixed rate, begin 'users' calls at startup,
                      and keep the number of calls constant.

*** Retransmission and timeout options:

   -recv_timeout    : Global receive timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If the expected message
                      is not received, the call times out and is aborted.
   -send_timeout    : Global send timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If a message is not sent
                      (due to congestion), the call times out and is aborted.
   -timeout         : Global timeout. Default unit is seconds.  If this option is set, SIPp quits
                      after nb units (-timeout 20s quits after 20 seconds).
   -timeout_error   : SIPp fails if the global timeout is reached is set (-timeout option
                      required).
   -max_retrans     : Maximum number of UDP retransmissions before call ends on timeout.  Default
                      is 5 for INVITE transactions and 7 for others.
   -max_invite_retrans: Maximum number of UDP retransmissions for invite transactions before call
                      ends on timeout.
   -max_non_invite_retrans: Maximum number of UDP retransmissions for non-invite transactions before call
                      ends on timeout.
   -nr              : Disable retransmission in UDP mode.
   -rtcheck         : Select the retransmission detection method: full (default) or loose.
   -T2              : Global T2-timer in milli seconds

*** Third-party call control options:

   -3pcc            : Launch the tool in 3pcc mode ("Third Party call control"). The passed IP
                      address depends on the 3PCC role.
                      - When the first twin command is 'sendCmd' then this is the address of the
                        remote twin socket.  SIPp will try to connect to this address:port to send
                        the twin command (This instance must be started after all other 3PCC
                        scenarios).
                          Example: 3PCC-C-A scenario.
                      - When the first twin command is 'recvCmd' then this is the address of the
                        local twin socket. SIPp will open this address:port to listen for twin
                        command.
                          Example: 3PCC-C-B scenario.
   -master          : 3pcc extended mode: indicates the master number
   -slave           : 3pcc extended mode: indicates the slave number

                      default value is 10ms.
   -max_recv_loops  : Set the maximum number of messages received read per cycle. Increase this
                      value for high traffic level.  The default value is 1000.

Signal handling:

   SIPp can be controlled using POSIX signals. The following signals
   are handled:
   USR1: Similar to pressing the 'q' key. It triggers a soft exit
         of SIPp. No more new calls are placed and all ongoing calls
         are finished before SIPp exits.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR1 732
   USR2: Triggers a dump of all statistics screens in
         <scenario_name>_<pid>_screens.log file. Especially useful 
         in background mode to know what the current status is.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR2 732

Exit codes:

   Upon exit (on fatal error or when the number of asked calls (-m
   option) is reached, SIPp exits with one of the following exit
   code:
    0: All calls were successful
    1: At least one call failed
   97: Exit on internal command. Calls may have been processed
   99: Normal exit without calls processed
   -1: Fatal error
   -2: Fatal error binding a socket
